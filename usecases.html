                              • <b>Inadequate policies and broken commitments:</b> Blockchain can provide permanent and transparent records of climate policies, Nationally Determined Contributions, environmental commitments, compliance, penalties, and impact, which can be reviewed and used to demand accountability, minimize greenwashing, and promote inclusive policymaking through decentralized governance.<br>
                              • <b>Limited participation of vulnerable groups:</b> Indigenous communities, women, marginalized groups, and youth can participate in climate action decision-making through blockchain mechanisms such as proposals, open consultation, appeals, feedback, and voting, ensuring consideration of inputs and protection of identities. Inclusive governance strengthens climate action.<br>
                              • <b>Lack of adaptation preparedness:</b> Blockchain can improve preparedness for climate change impacts through tamper-proof records of adaptation plans, resources, and timelines, verifiable proofs of adaptation drills and preparedness, decentralized management of relief and rebuilding, and smart contracts governing the automatic release of funds based on a declaration of disasters to expedite responses.<br>

                              • <b>Overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices:</b> Tamper-proof records of fishing licenses, quotas, seasons, catch limits, penalties for violations, fishing credits or tokens for sustainable catches, and ratings and certifications of fishing communities and businesses highlighting sustainability are some of the mechanisms that enable sustainable management of marine resources.<br>
                              • <b>Limited protection of marine habitats:</b> Transparent management of funds for protection, patrolling, research, and restoration of habitats like mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, etc., smart contracts governing the release of funds based on milestones achieved in declaration and management of protected areas as marine sanctuaries or conservation sites, and verifiable proofs of conservation outcomes through satellite imagery, reports, certifications, etc.<br>
                              • <b>Lack of awareness:</b> Eco-badges or certifications for adopting environmentally responsible behaviors and seafood choices, knowledge-sharing platforms preventing the spread of misinformation and encouraging experiential learning opportunities, and performance-based incentives and rewards for meeting sustainability goals in personal, community, or industry practices are some of the mechanisms that improve awareness about the importance of life below water and sustainable ocean practices.<br>

                              • <b>Deforestation and loss of biodiversity:</b> Tamper-proof records of logging licenses, quotas, seasons, and penalties for illegal felling or hunting, forest credits or tokens for sustainable use of woodlands, and ratings and certifications of communities, businesses, and countries highlighting environmental responsibility are some of the mechanisms that enable sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation.<br>
                              • <b>Forest fires and damage:</b> Permanent and verifiable records of fire incidents, causes, damages, responses, the relief provided, and penalties for arson, and decentralized fire monitoring through sensors and communities are some of the mechanisms that improve the detection and management of forest fires.<br>
                              • <b>Land degradation and desertification:</b> Transparent management of funds for desalination, afforestation, usage of waste for land regeneration, and soil conservation methods like farming terraces, contour bunds, etc., and direct disbursal of funds prevent diversion while real-time monitoring ensures proper utilization. These mechanisms facilitate sustainable land use and combat desertification.<br>

                              • <b>Limited access to justice:</b> Smart contracts facilitating automated enforcement and penalty mechanisms for petty crimes and civil disputes based on verifiable proofs of wrongdoing, micro-grants, and subsidized legal aid, especially for marginalized communities, and community mediation platforms enabling affordable and localized dispute resolution based on agreed terms and verifiable consensus are some of the mechanisms that provide low-cost access to legal and judicial services.<br>
                              • <b>Violation of human rights:</b> Blockchain technologies aim to protect identities of reporters while enabling action against perpetrators of discrimination, violence, oppression, censorship, unlawful imprisonment, torture, forced displacement, etc. Verifiable proofs of abuse establish credibility, determine responsibility, and mandate penalty or compensation depending on the nature and scale of violation.<br>
                              • <b>Lack of inclusive governance:</b> Open consultation platforms enabling proposals, debates, and feedback on policies, budgets, and development agendas from all stakeholders, including grassroots groups, decentralized voting on local issues, especially those concerning underrepresented communities, and appeals and whistleblower policies for dissenters to report undemocratic practices are some of the mechanisms that promote inclusive governance.<br>

                              • <b>Broken commitments and sustainability concerns:</b> Blockchain provides permanent proof of commitments, actions, and impact enabling long-term assessment of partnerships. Verifiable records of pledges on funding, timelines, milestones, goals, etc., hold partners accountable for meeting or reneging on commitments.<br>
                              • <b>Limited inclusion of non-state actors:</b> Blockchain enables marginalized groups such as grassroots groups, local communities, women, youth, indigenous people, refugees, etc. to participate in development partnerships by providing them access to resources, funds, data, and capacity-building opportunities based on verifiable proofs of inclusiveness through decentralized networks.<br>
                              • <b>Lack of coordination and duplication of efforts:</b> Blockchain provides a permanent and transparent record of commitments, roles, responsibilities, budgets, timelines, progress, and impact of all partners in sustainable development partnerships. This facilitates accountability, detection of duplication, and fixing of responsibility in case of delays or setbacks.<br>
