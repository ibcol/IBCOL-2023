                                  - Ratings and reviews highlighting responsibility and reliability of individual partners as well as the partnership as a whole. Reputation concerns discourage broken promises and motivate sustainably fulfilling obligations.<br>
                              - Limited inclusion of non-state actors: Blockchain enables participation of grassroots groups, local communities, women, youth, indigenous people, refugees, etc. in development partnerships. Mechanisms include:<br>
                                  - Decentralized networks providing marginalized groups access to resources, funds, data, capacity building opportunities, etc. based on verifiable proofs of inclusiveness.<br>
                                  - Smart contracts formalizing roles and releasing funds/resources directly to non-state partners based on achievements. Transparency reduces risks usually barring their participation.<br>
                                  - Appeals policies allowing groups to report undemocratic practices, lack of public good in decisions and demand corrective action without fear of retaliation. Verifiable integrity of the process protects dissent in the public interest.<br>
